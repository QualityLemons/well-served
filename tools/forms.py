"""Form classes for all tool implementations.

Each class in this module maps 1-to-1 to a tool implementation class in
``tools/implementations.py`` and to an entry in ``tools/registry.py``.

Responsibility split
--------------------
* Form-level validation (handled here): confirms that required fields are
  present and non-empty so Django can surface field errors before the tool
  runs.
* Content validation (handled by ``BaseTool.validate``): applies tool-specific
  rules (e.g. minimum length) after the form has passed its own checks.
